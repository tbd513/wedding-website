                  <p>We met on Mt.Hood in the spring of 2013. Two career focused, active, big personality Portlander’s, that at the time found no connection beyond another person to wave at while on the mountain. Later that fall during a chance meet up for coffee and lunch, conversations sparked interests in one another, revealing striking similarities <em>(we both have brothers for example)</em>. As winter approached we transitioned from coffee drinking buddies to snowboarding mates, soon realizing there was more to our story. Little did we know that our initial lunchbreak meetups and flirtations on the mountain would result in an unbreakable friendship and the love for each other we have today.</p>

                  <p>That day came one month later while exploring British Columbia during a February ski vacation. On our final day in the mountains we found ourselves in an isolated grove of trees without anyone around. Stumbling my words, I slowly proposed to Nikki and she quickly accepted, allowing me to slip the giant fake rock onto her finger.</p>

                  <p>We were both wrapped up in the moment and almost left the woods without a visual reminder of the occasion. Wiping tears from my cheek, trying to regain composure, it was Nikki who smartly suggested we snap a photo together before we emerge from the woods as an engaged couple.</p>

                  <p>Having both lived in Portland, Oregon for the past eight years and having met each other on Mt.Hood, it is only fitting that we have our family and friends unite here. Planning a wedding in less than a year has lead us to a location less traveled and we couldn’t be more happy with this decision. The Husum Highlands Bed and Breakfast is a beautiful mountain venue that’s a bit off the beaten wedding trail.</p>

The town’s natural beauty, easy access to Portland and a booming vacation house rental market, made our decision to get married here easy. We recommend you pad your travels with an extra day in Hood River to enjoy the many activities found in this lush apple growing valley below Mt.Hood.</p>

                  <p>When looking for a venue, camping was an important factor. If you want to stay on after the music stops and don’t want to fork out cash for a hotel room, then this is for you. I can’t guarantee Nikki will stay up past the 10pm bar closure but anyone is welcome to camp.
There are few flat locations to set up tents before the ceremony and no flat parking for car camping unfortunately. The best camping will be in the ceremony lawn, where 5 plus tent will fit comfortably. There are two wooden tent platforms above the B&B grounds and another gaming side lawn where more tents will fit.</p>

                  <p>This is by far the best option if you don’t want to camp. There are many vacation homes for rent in Hood River, most of which are found on <a href="https://www.vrbo.com/vacation-rentals/usa/oregon/mt-hood-the-gorge/hood-river?from-date=2016-09-23&to-date=2016-09-25" target="_blank">VRBO</a> or <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/s/Hood-River--OR--United-States?guests=4&ss_id=xsl9od4n&source=bb&s_tag=hnkui2oF" target="_blank">AirBnB</a>. We suggest you choose a location close to downtown to be near the shuttle service drop off location and all the wonderful restaurants, breweries and shops. Prices for a good rental run between $125-$300 per night.</p>

                  <p>There are a few hotel options in Hood River. The <a href="http://www.hoodriverinn.com/" target="_blank">Best Western</a> has the best located on the river near the bridge to Washington. The rooms for this time of year run roughly $250 a night. There is a <a href="http://www.comfortsuiteshoodriver.com/" target="_blank">Comfort Suites</a> west of downtown. It is not located in the most scenic area but the room rates are more reasonable, roughly $160-$180 a night. If you are looking for a more unusual place to stay there is the <a href="http://www.columbiagorgehotel.com/"target="_blank">Columbia Gorge Hotel</a>. It is a vintage hotel with beautiful gardens and views of the river. The rooms can be a little small for families but kitschy, clean, and unique. Rooms are about $290.</p>

They will most likely be found next to the bar chatting everyone up and getting the party started before the ceremony. We will have the ceremony start around 5pm. The party will start shortly after and continue until 10pm. Expect cool weather after sunset. This is an outdoor wedding on the edge of the Cascade mountains.</p>

                <h3>Getting There</h3>
                <p>This small B&B is a 20 minute drive north from Hood River, which puts it about 1 hour and 20 minutes from PDX airport. Drive north on Highway 141 that runs along the White Salmon river in Washington until you hit the very, very small town of Husum where you take a right on Oak Ridge road. You arrive at the B&B only after miles spent climbing a maintained dirt road that seems a little too long. Don’t worry, you’re getting close to a good view.<br />
